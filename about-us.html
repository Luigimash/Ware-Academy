                Her guitar students won 1st prizes in all categories entered in the 2013 North York Arts Festival, prompting
                the director to award trophies to the “best junior guitarist” (Nicolas Lee) and “best senior guitarist” (Kevin Gai).
                Lynn’s student Helen Lu won the CMC competition for guitar in the under 16 category, while Kevin Gai received
                the highest mark for string ensemble performance in the Kiwanis Music Festival (Vivaldi Concerto in D Major).

                Sergio Abreu, Eduardo Fernandez and Turibio Santos. Eli Kassner was most influential in shaping her technical
                development. As a young performer, she premiered many 20th century American and Canadian compositions. She has composed and
                recorded her own compositions on her 5 CDs including The Many Moods of the Guitar, Impossible Dream, Forest Scenes,

                achieved the highest RCMusic theory grades in Canada.

                            of Cincinnati and Yale University. His principal teachers include Krzysztof Penderecki, Toru
