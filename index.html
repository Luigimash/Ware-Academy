				<h2>Welcome to WARE Academy!</h2>

			<p><img src="images/Lynn-Ware-music-teacher.jpg" alt="" class="image image-responsive" /> </p>
			<p>Welcome to Ware Academy of Music. Iâ€™m Lynn Ware, owner and Certified RCMusic teacher of theory and classical guitar.
				Peter and I have been preparing students for RCMusic theory and instrumental examinations for over 30 years.
				Peter received his M.M. degree in composition from Yale University, under Toru Takemitsu and Kryztof Penderecki.
				I completed my M.M. degree in guitar performance at Kent State University. We are both RCMusic National Gold Medal Teachers.</p>
			<p>Our RCMusic teachers hold DMA and MM performance degrees in their area of specialization. Ware Academy Theory
				Classes for RCMusic Exams have nurtured four RCMusic National Theory Gold Medal Winners, representing the achievement of the highest theory
				grades in Canada. Our teachers, parents and students form a tight community, bonding to develop personal talents.
				One-on-one, private lessons are available in Theory, Piano, Guitar, Violin, Viola, Flute, Piccolo, Saxophone,
				Clarinet, Cello, Oboe, Bassoon and Singing. Call during the day or stop by during business hours. Hope to see you soon!</p>
			<p>With <strong>Four RCMusic National Gold Medals Winners in Music Theory, Ware's students achieved the highest-grade averages in
				Canada</strong> for all theory requirements for their ARCT. For students merely interested in passing, our unified
				methods and textbooks make it as easy as possible generating a low failure rate. Parents need to recognize
				that Harmony and History classes are 3-hour, university level exams. Study and homework practice are required!
				Textbooks offer an easy review before the exam with no handouts to lose.</p>
